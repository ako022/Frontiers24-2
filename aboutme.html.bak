            <h1>Ako's Page - About Me</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the <a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a> page!</p>
            <p class="boxedcontent">I am currently enrolled in the second
              session of <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/pre-collegiate/summer-programs/frontiers">Worcester
                Polytechnic Institute's Frontiers program</a>, a two-week
              in-person residential program where high school students have the
              opportunity both to learn from college professors and to gain
              exposure to college life. My major is computer science and my
              minor is psychology. </p>
            <p>I enjoy each class I take at my high school for various reasons,
              though most of all because I enjoy the act of learning itself. I
              find it absolutely fascinating to discover new things about
              various fields and to see, through that discovery, how
              interconnected our world is. Concepts and patterns from history
              affect our literature and the nature of our world today; each STEM
              subject plays seamlessly into the other; and between it all,
              humanities and arts course teach us about our nature as human
              beings.</p>
            <p>Beyond school, I also enjoy spending my free time reading,
              drawing, and running. I play the flute for my school's Symphonic,
              Pep, and Jazz Bands, and I plan to join the cross country team
              this fall!</p>
            <p>I also have two lovely kitties, Oscar and Ophelia, in addition to
              a younger sister. </p>
